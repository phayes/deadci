DeadCI is a lightweight continuous integration and testing server that integrates seamlessly with GitHub (other platforms coming). As the name implies it is dead easy to use. DeadCI works by running a command of your choice at the root of repository being built. It's easy to run [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org) jobs from a `.travis.yml` locally. It also integrates nicely with [JoliCI](https://github.com/jolicode/JoliCi) to run yours tests inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container.
